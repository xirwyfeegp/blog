* I was thinking of going to that party later.

* I was wondering if your report was ready.

* It's time we left.

* I wish I had more time.

* Suppose we went on holiday to Thailand.

* The match kicks off at two o'clock.

* Rio passes the baton to Tokyo.

* It's time to wrap up the quiz.

* Hanna should have studied harder. She underestimated the difficulty of the Maths exam.

* I had to peer into the distance to read the road sign, but I'm glad I was following the correct route to town.

* How did I achieve my great figure? Well, I put it down to diet and exercise.

* By the sound of it, we're all getting a pay rise at the end of this month!

* Does anyone know where Ebru is? There's not been sight or sound of her all week.

* I know it sounds strange, but I've never been on social media.

* What do you mean we're going to be working weekends from now on? I don't like the sound of that.

* I'm having a bit of a problem at work - is OK if I come round later and sound you out about it?

* Green Park.
